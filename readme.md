    e) Update package.xml and CMakeLists.txt as needed. 
    f) Run cpplint on your ROS package files, fix applicable issues (if any) and save the output as a text file to the repository
    g) Run cppcheck on your ROS package files, fix applicable issues (if any) and save the output as a text file to the repository
    h) Create a readme.md that provides an overview and build/run steps. Define assumptions/dependencies (e.g. ROS 2 Humble).
